2024-2025 Code

Description:

	This code is for our robot going into the 2025 game. It uses swerve drive as the drivetrain. 

Coding Style:

	Command - Subsystem

Prerequisites:
	
	To run this code, you will need the most recent version of WPILib. Once installed you will also need the Rev Robotics software library. More information on the installation can be found at https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/3rd-party-libraries.html.

Installation:

	You can simply download the project and open the base folder in WPILib. Gradle may need to run a build process, but it shouldn't take long.

Configuration:

	Most of the specific configuration settings can be found in Constants.java. The biggest thing to worry about is the motor controller ids. 

Usage:

	Once you've imported the files to a WPILib project you must build and deploy them. All of this can be done via the three dots in the top right of the WPILib window. More infomation can be found on the official WPILib website that was previously linked.

Final Notes:

	It's not perfect or pretty, but it got the job done. We have published this code under the GNU Public License. The official license is under LICENSE per tradition. May this code help another beginner programmer.
